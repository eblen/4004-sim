Issue 1:  Typewriter application initially stuck
Priority: medium
Status:   fixed

The typewriter does not print the first character typed until a second character
is typed. Afterwards, it seems to work correctly.

Fixed by simply refreshing after printing a character.

Issue 2:  Unclear how to handle a 2-byte instruction across ROM boundaries
Priority: low
Status:   open

As marked in "cpu.cpp," it is unclear how to handle such instructions, but it is
probably not terribly important.

Issue 3:  Unclear why "flushinp" is needed for keyboard input
Priority: medium
Status:   fixed

This is marked in "keyboard.h" and may be related to issue 1.

Fixed. The fix for issue 1 removes the need for flushinp.

Issue 4: Definition of "local" ROM is technically incorrect
Priority: low
Status:   open

For the ISZ instruction, we use the high nibble of IP as the current ROM.
However, IP points to the next instruction, not ISZ itself. This will be
incorrect if an ISZ instruction is the last instruction of a ROM. Such code
would likely be brittle anyway, since any code insertions or deletions prior to
ISZ could change the jump target!
